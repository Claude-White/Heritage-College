The game randomly selects a word and the
player tries to guess it by guessing letters. Each
incorrect guess brings you closer to being "hanged".

If the word is dog, the spaces are drawn
like this: _ _ _.

The player has to guess one letter at a time. The letter
is filled in everywhere it appears on the appropriate
dash (or dashes) each time the person guesses
correctly. One body part is added to the drawing each
time the letter chosen is not in the word. If the
drawing of the person is completed before the word
is guessed, the player loses. If the player figures out
the word first, they win.
